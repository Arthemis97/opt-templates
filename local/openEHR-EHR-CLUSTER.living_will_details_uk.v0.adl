Living will is also known as Advance Directive in Scotland, and as Advance Decision in England and Wales.

An individual with capacity may create a living will document to record their wishes for medical care and treatment in advance, which is intended to guide decision-making in future situations in which the individual is unable to make or communicate decisions. In England and Wales, a living will is a legally-binding document, while, in Scotland, it is legally persuasive without having an official legal status.

A living will is commonly used to refuse life-sustaining treatment which may include, but is not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), clinically assisted nutrition and hydration, artificial or mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics for life-threatening infections. 

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used within the EVALUATION.living_will archetype to adhere to the legal and other local requirements for living wills in the UK.">
